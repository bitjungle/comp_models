# Compartmental models in epidemiology

## Data analysis and models for predicting SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 disease spread 

Please **DO NOT USE** these models for prediction of corona virus spread.
I am NOT an epidemiologists. I have made these models because I have an 
interest in matehematical modelling. Trust your local government when 
it comes to prediction and actions to prevent spread.
