# COVID-19 Modelling
## Data analysis and models for predicting covid-19 spread 

Please **DO NOT USE** these models for prediction of COVID-19 spread.
I am NOT an epidemiologists. I have made these models because I have an 
interest in matehematical modelling. Trust your local government when 
it comes to prediction of COVID-19 spread and actions to prevent spread.
